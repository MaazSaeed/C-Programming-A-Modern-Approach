#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{

    printf("xx");
    #if 0
        everything can be left unfinished in here other than comments
        comments need to be terminated e.g /* must be ended by this */
        thats because comments are processed before preprocessing!!!!
    #endif // 0

    return 0;
}
